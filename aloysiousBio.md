Hello there, My name is Aloysious

And I make use of they/them pronouns.

I spent a little over 13 years in the Army with a big ol nerdy passion for logistics. I sought out and took advantage of any opportunities to grow professionally. I was also able to develop and apply a wide range of skill sets throughout my various leadership roles.

I had a lot of fun but I also got to a point where I had lost interest in learning what was left and got tired of being away from my daughter so much.

In those formative years I honed in on a resilience to....and sort of a reverse logistics mindset for change. I am highly self motivated and can adapt quickly.

In spaces where the information and processes are constantly changing I thrive.

My ability to capture many details and moving pieces and ability to implement them into process flows allow me to be an incredibly beneficial member to any efforts I choose to focus my attention to.

I'm excited to see all the ways I am able to contribute in the tech industry. I am also looking forward to creating a life where I can spend more time with my loved ones.

I heard that change is a constant in the tech industry...I'm really into that....

I also hear that the computer is like a bicycle for the brain...and well I guess I'm just ready to start riding that bike ya know?


4. **What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.**

* I am most excited about the possibilities of making resources more accessible to others and hopeful that there will be enough people in the right places at the right time to ensure accountability in the realms of data between businesses/ corporations and consumers.
