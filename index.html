        <h2>( they  ðŸ’» them )</h2>
        <p>Hello there, My name is Aloysious<br>
          <br> 
          I spent a little over 13 years in the Army with a big ol nerdy passion for logistics.<br> 
          I sought out and took advantage of any opportunities to grow professionally.<br>
          I was also able to develop and apply a wide range of skill sets throughout my various leadership roles.
          <br><br>
          I had a lot of fun but I also got to a point where I had lost interest in learning what was left<br>  
          and got tired of being away from my daughter so much.
          <br><br>
          In those formative years I honed in on a resilience to....and sort of a reverse logistics mindset for change. <br> 
          I am highly self motivated and can adapt quickly.
          <br><br>
          In spaces where the information and processes are constantly changing I thrive.
          <br><br>
          My ability to capture many details and moving pieces and ability to implement them into process flows<br> 
          allows me to be an incredibly beneficial member to any efforts I choose to focus my attention to.
          <br><br>
          I'm excited to see all the ways I am able to contribute in the tech industry.<br>
          I am also looking forward to creating a life where I can spend more time with my loved ones.
          <br><br>
          I heard that change is a constant in the tech industry...I'm really into that....
          <br><br>
          I also hear that the computer is like a bicycle for the brain...<br>
          and well I guess I'm just ready to start riding that bike ya know?.....ðŸš´!</p>
